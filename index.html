        <h1>What Will Your Car Cost When It's Made In Trump's America?</h1>
        <h2><a href="http://twitter.com/prachibhard" target="_blank">By: Prachi Bhardwaj</a></h2>
        <p class="main-text">
            An American-brand car was only the sixth most “American” car last year, meaning a tariff would make all cars more expensive for consumers, years before domestic factories could make them more affordable.
            <br><br> The numbers on January’s Durable Good Orders report showed that orders for vehicles and vehicle parts were up last month. Durable goods are products intended to last at least three years, and a large contributing factor to this sector
            is transportation.
            <br><br> “Vehicles and auto parts [orders] remain strong. That’s certainly a good sign for consumer activity and their spending patterns,” said economist Russel Price, a senior economist at Ameriprise Financial Inc. Heightened consumer confidence
            translates to more orders for auto parts from manufacturing companies.
            <br><br> This outlook is contingent on the assumption that auto prices will remain relatively constant, however. President Trump’s intention to impose a 20% tariff on imported parts would be a 5% increase in the price of even the most “American”
            American-brand car.
            <br><br> The American-Made Index* (AMI) is a list of the top 10 passenger vehicles in order of how “American” they are. This metric is determined by calculating what percent of the model’s parts were made in America. In order to qualify for
            the list, 75% of a car must be made in America.
            <br><br> But there haven’t been enough qualified cars to fill all of the spots since 2011, meaning fewer than 10 car models are at least 75% American today. There were eight cars on the May update to the <a href="https://www.cars.com/articles/the-2016-carscom-american-made-index-1420684865874/"
                target="_blank">2016 AMI</a> report, and the only American brands on it were ranked sixth, seventh, and eighth.

        <p class="main-text">
            Donald Trump has approached the CEOs of the Detroit Three - General Motors Co., Fiat Chrsyler, and Ford – about opening plants in the United States and manufacturing domestically, in hopes of creating new jobs. When prices go up and sales slow, however,
            auto manufacturers have two options: set discount prices or lay off workers.
            <br><br> Chris Cefaretti works as a car salesman on the floor of the Desert 215 Superstore – a Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram dealership in Las Vegas, whose parent company is Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.
            <br><br> “It’s not going to really upset me I don’t think,” said Cefaretti, referring to the potential tariff. “I mean I’m selling American vehicles. I don’t know if it’s been different for say the Toyota or the Nissan brands.”
            <br><br> Only one 2017 Fiat Chrysler car qualified for the AMI in the most updated American Automobile Labeling Act report. Honda had seven qualifying cars that were 75% American, and Toyota had one.
            <br><br> What Cefaretti and his colleagues might not have taken into account is that, due to the nature of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a lot of domestic car parts’ supply chains send them across borders multiple times before they
            reach their final destination.
            <br><br> The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a deal between Canada, Mexico, and the United States that reduces – and in some cases, eliminates – the tariffs on the products traded within the continent. The agreement has been
            in effect since 1994, and in the decades since, it has led to cost-effective supply chains, allowing domestic cars to stay competitive in a globalized auto industry.
            <br><br> President Trump intends to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement in order to discourage importing from Mexico and Canada. Without the agreement, the parts that are sent over borders multiple times over might make the
            tariff on the cars Cefaretti sells higher than the tariff on the Toyota or Nissan cars he referred to.
            <br><br> “There’s fluctuation every couple of weeks, or every month at least, no matter what,” he said in response to the explanation of the price-changes his dealership might experience. He and his co-workers are not commission based, so
            the changes to their paychecks might be too marginal to notice until it’s too late.
            <br><br>

            *The percentages in the index also account for parts manufactured in Canada due to the 1992 American Automobile Labeling Act, which lumps US and Canada together with regards to the word “domestic.” We can safely assume that the tariffs – and thus the
            resulting prices – would be marginally higher than what is shown.
